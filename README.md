### Branch Layout
The master branch should be reserved for stable code only. All unstable and in development code should exist in separate branches, with Dev-Master being the master development branch. When the current state of Dev-Master is deemed stable, it should be merged into Master to become the latest stable version. It is suggested that each feature in development have its own branch based on Dev-Master. It is also suggested that each member of the team, or each team in the project work within a separate repo based on Dev-Master to prevent conflicts in small commits.
